PART 2: First Web Page. 
What it does: This is a simple web page that displays information about the last two NBA champions. It provides
pictures of the last two champions and there are links to articles about their championship runs. There is also a table
that displays the winning team and the Finals MVP for the last two seasons. There is also a link to a website that explains
the basic rules of the NBA for those wanting to learn about the basics.
